# OpenPBTA-analysis

The Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA) Project is an effort to describe the landscape of tumors in the [Children's Brain tumor Tissue Consortium](https://cbttc.org/) and the PNOC003 DIPG clinical trial from the [Pediatric Pacific Neuro-oncology Consortium](http://www.pnoc.us/).
This is an open analysis effort that is organized on GitHub.
There is a [companion OpenPBTA-manuscript repository](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-manuscript/) that is being used to author a collaborative manuscript describing the effort.
The project maintainers include scientists from [Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation's Childhood Cancer Data Lab](https://www.ccdatalab.org/) and the [Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://d3b.center/).
